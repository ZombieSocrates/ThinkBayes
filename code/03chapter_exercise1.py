Exercise from chapter 3 introduced the power law (1/x)^(-alpha),
but assumed that any train we saw came from one company of 
unknown size x.

Now assume that we are observing trains from an unknown number
of companies. What's the probability that we see N = 60

My answer as of right now is that this just reduces back to
the uniform case.
